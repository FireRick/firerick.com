If you haven't been to China, you probably won't know that in mainland China, you can't connect to Google's servers, so you won't be able to use Google's various services. 

In addition to Google, well-known websites such as facebook, twitter, and youtube are also unable to connect. This is mainly because mainland China's network service providers have filtered requests for these web servers.

Therefore, there is a search engine developed by a local company in China, called Baidu. This is a search engine that focuses on Chinese search, so there is basically no one to use except Chinese.

Like search engines, people in mainland China can only choose to use local social software due to network restrictions. 

More than a decade ago, many people used Microsoft's MSN. By now, most people are already using local social software. These softwares are mainly WeChat, QQ, Weibo and so on. 

Based on China's huge population, these companies have become very large and are among the top Internet companies in the world.
