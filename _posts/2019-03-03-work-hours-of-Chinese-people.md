Generally speaking, in China, most people start work between 8 and 9 o'clock and leave work between 17 and 18 o'clock. At noon, there is usually 1 to 2 hours of rest for meals and lunch breaks. That is to say, most people work 6 to 9 hours a day.

In the week, you need to work for 5 days, and the rest of the two days to rest.

In addition, there are also statutory holidays that do not require work. There are 7 holidays listed below.

But not everyone is so lucky. At present, there are a large number of people in China who are suffering from overtime, especially young people living in big cities, because the prices of housing in big cities are very high. Most people may not be able to buy 2 square meters of income for a whole year. So they are under tremendous economic pressure, and they don't have much bargaining chip on their work, because they need a steady income to repay the monthly housing loan. In addition to working overtime on weekday nights, weekends often have no time to rest, and sometimes even need to work until the early morning.

Most technology companies have the most serious overtime, such as software companies, mobile phone manufacturers, Internet companies and so on. Huawei, a well-known company, has even turned overtime into a culture, but its rationality has been controversial. Everyone has their own views.
